# Why bother?

- As a statistician working in any capacity, you will need to know some programming
  - As a MS/PhD student in Biostats, you will do some serious programming!
- Good programming practices will help you with research, collaborating, your job search, and your long-term career... whichever path you choose!

# Welcome!

Biost 561 covers modern/advanced R and other programming skills
  - It is designed for graduate students in Biostatistics, and is tailored to their statistics and programming background  
  - If you don't know a lot of base R already, you will learn it today and in Homework 1

# Structure and expectations

- Weekly lectures
- Weekly homeworks
- Weekly office hours: HSB F-657. Mondays TBD
- Office hours by appointment

# About you

Everyone is here with different backgrounds in programming and computing. Let's get statistical!

?? responses to class survey

- ?? Mac-Windows users
- ??\% have used R
- ??\% use the apply() family
- ??\% pipe, write packages
- ??\% use git for **version control**

Is data missing at random?

# Today's class

1. Version control with git
2. Intro to base `R` (types, methods)
5. RStudio & RStudio projects
3. Writing loops and functions
4. LaTex, RMarkdown and knitr

# Version control

What problems can you see with the following approach to version control?

- papersims-v1.R
- papersims-v2.R
- papersims-thea-comments.R
- papersims-hellfire.R
- papersims-v5.R
- papersims-final.R


# Version control

1. How many versions until this becomes intractable?
2. *Date Modified* sorting does not always help
3. Tracking the changes is very difficult; what happens if you need to revert?
4. Exponential file number growth with multiple collaborators!
5. The dreaded computer crash

Dropbox can help with some of these issues, but generally not (3) or (4)!

# Git

- git is an open source version control system (VCS):
    - Track changes to code and documents. *What* changes by *who* and *when*?
    - Share code and collaborate

- github is a website that uses git's VCS:
    - Collaborate with others effectively
    - Distribute code
    - Solicit improvements (*pull* requests)
    - Track issues & feature requests
    - (Build your coding portfolio!)

# Git with R

Git & github are popular with R developers

- Integration with RStudio
- Easy distribution of packages
    - Circumvents CRAN moderators; for better or worse
- Always get the latest features (`devtools`; `install_github`)
(in addition to all the other great things about good version control)

# Getting started with git

- Download/update: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
- Intro: <https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/>
    - Do this with Homework 1 and a blank pdf, not hello-world
- With RStudio: File/New Project
- Questions? Error messages? The internet is a great resource!
- A great habit to get into early!

Homework 1 Question 0 will get you started using git. More later in the semester!

# R: Class

There are many different *classes* of objects in R

```{r, echo = TRUE}
x <- c(1, 2, 5)
y <- c("a", "b")
z <- as.factor(y)
c(class(x), class(y), class(z), class(c))
```

Others include `logical` (`TRUE`, `FALSE`), complex numbers...

# Modes

R has different modes. The mode tells the way a variable is stored.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
mode(x)
mode(y)
mode(z) # factors are stored as numerics
mode(c)
```

# Modes

`is.[class]` asks about the class. Normally you will be interested in the class, not the mode.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
is.numeric(x)
is.factor(z)
is.numeric(z) # we asked about class, not the mode
```

# Data structures

R can store data in various *objects*

- vector: one-dimensional, all data points have same mode
- matrix: two-dimensional, all data points have same mode
- data frame: two-dimensional, all data points in same column have same mode
- list: one-dimensional, data points can be of any type

# Matrices

Matrices vs data frames: all elements have same mode in matrices

```{r, echo=TRUE}
cbind(c(1,2), c("a", "b"))
```

# Matrices

```{r, echo=TRUE}
aa <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 5), nrow = 2, byrow = T)
bb <- c(0.5, 2)
aa
bb
```

# Matrices

Be very careful with matrix operations!

```{r, echo=TRUE}
aa %*% bb # matrix multiplication
aa * bb # careful! pointwise
```

# Data frames
\footnotesize
```{r, echo=TRUE}
data.frame(c(1,2), c("a", "b"))
dd <- data.frame("ID"=c(1,2), "name"=c("a", "b")) # better
dd
str(dd) # structure: compact info about frame & variables
```

# Vectorization

Vectorization: doing many calculations with a single command

```{r}
x <- c(0.5, 2, 3, 6)
x^2
y <- c(3, 1, 2, 1)
x^y
```

# Vectorization

The slow way: with loops. Avoid where possible!

```
z <- rep(NA, 4)
for (i in 1:4) {
  z[i] <- x[i]^y[i]
}
z
```

Code is easier to read, and usually easier to debug, when vectorised

# Recycling

In many tasks, R recycles elements of one input until it has enough to match the other

\footnotesize
```{r}
aa
bb
aa + bb # vectors are treated as columns!
cc <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
aa + cc # the silent killer
```

Be careful!

# Speed comparison
vectorization can cause major speed-ups, because task is optimised and precompiled in C/Fortran, not interpreted R.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
dd <- matrix(rnorm(1e6), nrow = 1000)
cor(dd)

ee <- matrix(NA, 1000, 1000)
for (i in 1:1000) {
  for (j in 1:1000) {
    ee[i, j] <- cor(ee[, i], ee[, j])
  }
}
```
Speed up factor of vectorization: 36!

# Lists

Lists store information of many different types. Names are optional, but recommended!


\footnotesize
```{r}
amy <- list(office.num = 657, pets = TRUE,
            pets.names = c("Princess Jaws", "Friendly", "Mohawk",
                           "Canada", "USA", "Regina George"),
            is.cat = c(TRUE, rep(FALSE, 5)))
amy
```

# Lists


Double square brackets pull out individual elements. Single square brackets pull out subsets of the list. I recommend using names wherever possible!

\footnotesize
```{r}
amy[[3]] # subset third element
amy[3] # third element -- a list!
```

# Lists

\footnotesize
```{r}
amy[2:3] # second and third elements -- a list!
amy$office # can also refer by name
```

# Generic functions

The same function can apply to objects of different classes. How does R know what to do?

\footnotesize
```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=2.5}
c(class(log), class(trees))
layout(t(1:2), widths = c(3,1)); plot(log); plot(trees)
```

# Generic functions

`plot` is a *generic* function. Generic functions don't do anything themselves -- they call *methods*, which are tailored to the class.

```{r}
plot
methods("plot") # lists all types R knows how to plot
```

If no specialised method exists for that class, R will call `summary.default()`

# Generic functions

To find the functions that apply to a class

```{r}
methods(class = "lm")
```

# Generic functions

To see the code for a generic function, type `[function].[class]`

```{r}
dimnames.data.frame
```

# Help

There are many ways to get help with using functions or debugging code

1. The internet

![](../images/google.png)


# Help

2. `?fn` shows the documentation for `fn`...

![](../images/questionmark.png)

# Help

2. ... if it exists!

![](../images/documentation.png)

# Help

3. `help.search("topic")` searches help pages for "topic"

![](../images/helpsearch.png)



# Examples

The documentation pages often show examples (`example(plot)`) and have demos (`demo(plotmath)`). `vignette()` opens longer worked examples that are great for playing with new packages.

![](../images/vignette.png)

# Keep in mind

- The user of a function assumes responsibility for giving arguments in the correct form
- arguments are ordered
    * Unnamed arguments are allocated as first arguments
    * Named arguments can be anywhere in ordering
- Not supplied arguments assume default value
    * Not supplying arguments without a default gives an error message

Don't get bogged down in reading *all* the documentation -- experiment and learn from your mistakes instead!

# Debugging

1. Stare at it until you identify the problem a.k.a. psychic debugging
2. Breakdown the components until you find the problem (bisection method converges linearly!)
3. `traceback()` -- covered later in the course
