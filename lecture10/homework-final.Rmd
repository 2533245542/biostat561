**Homework due Thursday 14 December, 2 p.m.** *Strictly no extensions.*

Office hours Monday 11 December, 2 p.m., and Wednesday 13 December, 9:30 a.m.

Be sure to upload a `.cpp` file, a `.py` file, and a `.R` file along with a `.pdf` file showing screenshots of your output along with your commentary.

# Question 1: C++

Write a C++ function that takes arguments `beta` (a vector of dimension `p`) and `n` (a scalar), generates data from the following model

$$
\begin{aligned}
X &\in R^{n \times p}, y \in R^n, \epsilon \in R^n \\
y &= X \beta + \epsilon \\
X_{i1} &= 1 \\
X_{i2} &\sim Bernoulli(0.7) \\
X_{i3} &\sim Uniform(-1, 1) \\
\epsilon_i &\sim N(0,1),
\end{aligned}
$$

writes $X$ and $y$ to output files, and returns the following estimate of `beta`: $$\hat{\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^TY.$$

Choose a vector `beta` of dimension 3, and confirm the output of your function using R's native matrix multiplication function.

You should be using Rcpp to interface the script with R.

# Question 2: Python

Repeat Question 1, this time writing a Python script to perform the same task.
