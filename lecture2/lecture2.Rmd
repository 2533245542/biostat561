# Housekeeping

- The high bar for Homework 1 was met
- Individual comments coming soon via Github Classroom

# Pop quiz

What is the distribution of the median of 51 exponentially-distributed random variables with  rate = 1?

# Pop quiz

What is the distribution of the median of 51 exponentially-distributed random variables with rate = 1?

- No idea? Me neither!
- How could we use computing power to help us?

# Avoiding math with computers

To understand the distribution of the median of 51 exponentially-distributed random variables with rate = 1, we can

- Draw 51 Exp(1) random variables, calculate their median
- Do this again, and again, and again...

We can use the collection of medians to calculate summary statistics, draw histograms, do hypothesis testing...

# Avoiding math with computers...

... and learning how to write loops in the process

```{r, echo = TRUE}
simulations <- 10000
many_medians <- rep(NA, simulations)
set.seed(171005)
for (i in 1:simulations) {
  my_sample <- rexp(n = 51, rate = 1)
  many_medians[i] <- median(my_sample)
}
```



# Avoiding math with computers


```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width=3, fig.height=2.5}
mean(many_medians) # actually: 0.70286
var(many_medians) # actually: 0.01978
```

We just calculated the moments of an intractable distribution using computing!


# Avoiding math with computers

We could work out almost anything about the sample median in this way!

The distribution of the median of 51 Exp(1) random variables:

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width=3, fig.height=2.5}
hist(many_medians)
```

# Reproducible simulations

```{r}
set.seed(9)
rexp(4)
rexp(4)
set.seed(9)
rexp(4)
```

# Structure of a for loop

`for()` loops are not terrible, but watch out:

- First make an empty object of the correct dimension (e.g. vector, matrix, data frame) and *then* fill it in
- Don't forget to store the output of each iteration!
- For large loops and objects, growing the output is a big slowdown
    - This is because of the way that memory is handled in R

# A special set up

The only use of the index `i` was for storage.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
simulations <- 10000
many_medians <- rep(NA, simulations)
set.seed(171005)
for (i in 1:simulations) {
  my_sample <- rexp(n = 51, rate = 1)
  many_medians[i] <- median(my_sample)
}
```

# A special set up

Since we are merely doing the same thing again and again, let's use a new function to take care of all of the admin

```{r}
set.seed(171005)
many_medians <- replicate(simulations, 
                          median(rexp(n = 51, rate = 1)))
```

The second argument to `replicate()` is the expression you want replicated

# Loop indices

The index of our loop (`i`) does not need to be a vector

```{r}
str(airquality) # a built-in dataset
```


# Loop indices

The index of our loop (`i`) does not need to be a vector

```{r}
for (month in unique(airquality$Month)) {
  print(mean(airquality$Ozone[airquality$Month == month], 
             na.rm = TRUE)) # prints but doesn't store
}
```

# Loop indices

A better way using `by()`

\footnotesize
```{r}
by(airquality$Ozone, list(month = airquality$Month), 
   mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

- "Break the data into subsets by month, then calculate the mean Ozone level for each month, omitting missing values"
- "Calculate the month-specific means of Ozone, omitting missing values"

# Looping over subsets: `by()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
by(airquality$Ozone, list(month = airquality$Month), 
   mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```
- First argument (`data`): variable to be analysed
- Second argument (`INDICES`): list of subsets. Could be multiple variables: `list(month = airquality$Month, toohot = airquality$Temp > 85)`
- Third argument (`FUN`) is the analysis function to use on the subsets
- Any other arguments (e.g. `na.rm=TRUE`) are used as additional arguments to the analysis function

# Looping over subsets: `by()`

- Output is an object of class `by`, which has its own print method, `print.by()`
- The implementation of print for objects of class `by` is kind of annoying: use `unclass()` to get rid of it

```{r}
ozone_summary <- by(airquality$Ozone, 
                    list(month = airquality$Month), 
                    mean, na.rm = TRUE)
unclass(ozone_summary) # one option
```


<!-- # Looping over subsets: `by()` -->

<!-- `by()` has an optional argument `simplify`:   -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # another option -->
<!-- another_ozone_summary <- by(airquality$Ozone,  -->
<!--                             list(month = airquality$Month),  -->
<!--                             mean, na.rm = TRUE,  -->
<!--                             simplify = TRUE) -->
<!-- another_ozone_summary -->
<!-- ``` -->

# Looping over variables: `apply()`

```{r}
apply(X=airquality, MARGIN=2, FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
```

- `X`: an array, usually a matrix or data frame
- `MARGIN`: the direction. `MARGIN = 1` applies the function to each row, `MARGIN = 2` applies the function to each column.
- `FUN`: the function to be applied
- Any other arguments to be passed to `FUN`

# Looking over variables: `apply()`

Ad-hoc functions can be defined inline:
```{r}
apply(airquality, 2,
      function(x) { c(mean = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE),
                      sd = sd(x, na.rm = TRUE))})
```

(but it's generally better to define them externally)

# Passing arguments through to other functions

```{r}
mean_and_sd <- function(x, ...) { c(mean = mean(x, ...), 
                                    sd = sd(x, ...)) }
apply(airquality, 2, mean_and_sd, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Debugging code with ellipses can be tricky! Be cautious...

# `by()`-ing more

Applying our own functions using `by()`

```{r}
by(airquality, list(toohot = airquality$Temp > 85),
   function(subset) { round(apply(subset, 2, mean_and_sd), 
                            digits = 2) })
```

# git

- To download all new material to your local copy, go to your materials folder and type `git pull`
    * This will give you lecture 2 and homework 2
- The standard workflow for adding a new file or updating an old one
```{r, eval = FALSE}
git pull
git add homework2-response.pdf
git commit -a -m 'question 2 part b response'
git push
```
- You must have a git repository set up already to do this (e.g. with `git init` or `git clone ...`)

#  Coming soon

- Homework 2 due next Thursday at 2 p.m.
    * Submission via github classroom
    * Same instructions as homework 1 -- but don't overwrite homework 1!
- Homework 1 feedback coming soon
- Next week: pipe operators!
