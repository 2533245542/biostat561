# This week

- Big challenge with Homework 2: working within requirements of each function
- Another challenging assignment, more great work
- Comments from homeworks go in README files
    * Each week, look in the repository for this

# RStudio

- You should save all of your work as scripts (`.R` files)
- Laying out your workspace effectively
    * Rstudio -> Preferences -> Pane Layout
- Running code quickly
    * With the cursor on the line of script you want to run...
         * `cmd + return` (Mac)
         * `ctrl + enter` (Windows)
- Commenting: precede comments by a `#`

# RStudio

`R` sessions are located somewhere on your computer

\footnotesize
```{r}
setwd("/Users/adwillis/Documents/") 
getwd() # where am I? 
# change to:
setwd("/Users/adwillis/Documents/teaching/17-561/lecture3/") 
```

# R packages

- Most packages are distributed via CRAN, a global network for the distribution of R code
    * You may need to set your "mirror"
    * RStudio -> Preferences -> Packages
- Packages need to be installed, and then loaded

\footnotesize
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse") # first download...
library(tidyverse) # ...then load
```

```{r, include=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse) # ...then load
```


# Writing beautiful code

Suppose you have a data frame of Star Wars characters `starwars` and you want to find the average weight of each species where we have data for more than 2 characters.


\footnotesize
```{r}
ns <- unclass(table(starwars$species))
means <- unclass(by(starwars, starwars$species, 
                    function(x) mean(x$mass, na.rm = TRUE)))
means[ns > 2]
```

What is lousy about this code?

# Writing beautiful code

Here is another way to write that code

\footnotesize
```{r}
starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            mass = mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(n > 2)
```

Which is easier to read? Which is easier to debug?

# tidyverse

The `tidyverse` is a collection of packages based on 4 principles for handling data:

1. Reuse existing data structures.
2. Compose simple functions with the pipe.
3. Embrace functional programming.
4. Design for humans.

The R project for Statistical Computing was built for a different age; the tidyverse is a collection of tools for *our* age

# tibbles

Data frames are great! Except for 

- printing them
- working with both characters and factors
- manipulating multiple columns

tibbles are the data frame alternative of the tidyverse


# tibbles

\footnotesize
```{r}
starwars
```

# tibbles

> A tibble, or tbl_df, is a modern reimagining of the data.frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not. Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: they do less (i.e. they don't change variable names or types, and don't do partial matching) and complain more (e.g. when a variable does not exist). This forces you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code. Tibbles also have an enhanced print method() which makes them easier to use with large datasets containing complex objects.

# How do we read code?

Translate the following code into words:

```{r}
length(unique(starwars$species))
```

# Intuitive coding

```{r}
starwars$species %>% 
  unique %>% 
  length
```

`%>%` is the "pipe operator"

- `f(x)` is the same as `x %>% f`
- "Take `x` and apply the function `f`"

# Intuitive coding

Using native tidyverse functions `group_by` and `summarise`/`summarize`

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(n()) %>% 
  nrow
```

# More piping

Multiple summary statistics at once

```{r}
starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            mean.mass = mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd.mass = sd(mass, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(n > 2)
```

# dplyr

*dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges:*

- `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
- `select()` picks variables based on their names.
- `filter()` picks cases based on their values.
- `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
- `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows

# dplyr: data manipulation

Show only certain variables

```{r}
starwars %>%
  select(name, ends_with("color"))
```

# dplyr: data manipulation

Show only certain variables

```{r}
starwars %>%
  filter(hair_color == "black",
         skin_color %in% c("fair", "light"))
```

# dplyr: data manipulation

Get summary statistics

```{r}
starwars %>%
  filter(hair_color == "black",
         skin_color %in% c("fair", "light")) %>% 
  summarise("mass" = mean(mass, na.rm = T))
```

`starwars` is from the package `tibble`, `%>%` is from the package `magrittr`, `filter` is from the package `dplyr`... Hence `tidyverse`!

# Advanced piping

- `x %>% f` is equivalent to `f(x)`
- `x %>% f(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`
- `x %>% f(y, .)` is equivalent to `f(y, x)`

# Watch out!

```{r, error=TRUE}
starwars 
  %>% filter(hair_color == "black",
         skin_color %in% c("fair", "light"))
  %>% summarise("mass" = mean(mass, na.rm = T))
```

# tidyverse

- Programming in R using the tidyverse will require you to unlearn some bad habits, and may be more difficult for experienced R programmers
- Learning this style will make your code more readable, debugable, and efficient
- Graduate school is the time to learn!
- I will ask you to redo homework questions if you do not write them in the style; all of your code should be using this syntax starting now!

# If wishes were horses...

... we would all be eating steak:

- "I wish that my output didn't spew numbers when I type `head(my_big_data_frame)`..."
- "I wish there was a function to tell me which elements in my vector that satisfy my condition..."
- "I wish there was a function to calculate minima pointwise..."

Similarly, "How do I turn a data frame into a tibble?"

#  Coming soon

- Homework 3 due next Thursday at 2 p.m.
    * All solutions need to be written in best coding practice (i.e., tidyverse)
    * Submission via github classroom
- Homework 2 feedback coming soon
- Next week: how to make awesome plots!
