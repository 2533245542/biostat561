# Graphical communication in practice

Graphical communication is critical for both *exploring* and *explaining* data

- base graphics in `R`: static
- `ggplot`: static
- `shiny`: interactive 
- Non-data-based figures

# Name to know: Edward Tufte

"If you’re not doing something different, you’re not doing anything at all."

The Rules:

1. Show Your Data
2. Use Graphics
3. Avoid Chartjunk
4. Utilize Data-ink
5. Use Labels
6. Utilize Micro/Macro
7. Separate Layers
8. Use Multiples
9. Utilize Color
10. Understand Narrative

<!-- 1. Show the data -->
<!-- 2. "Induce the viewer to think about the substance rather than about methodology, graphic design, the tech of graphic production, or something else." -->
<!-- 3. Avoid Distorting the Data -->
<!-- 4. Present Many Numbers in a Small Space -->
<!-- 5. Make Large Datasets Coherent -->
<!-- 6. Encourage Eyes to Compare Data -->
<!-- 7. Reveal Data at Several Levels of Detail -->
<!-- 8. Serve a Reasonably Clear Purpose -->
<!-- 9. Be Closely Integrated with Statistical and Verbal Descriptions of the Dataset -->

# ggplot

- `ggplot` is a function available in the `ggplot2` package.
- Graphics are built in layers: a plot is initialised, *then* data is then drawn, *then* annotations are added.
- Annotations include
    * scales
    * labels
    * legends
    * coordinate systems

# ggplot

![](images/documentation.png){width=400px}

# ggplot

```{r, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

# Initialize, *then* add plotting elements

\footnotesize
```{r, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_point()
```

# Customise features about the layer

\footnotesize
```{r, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_point(aes(col = color), alpha = 0.2)
```

# Add another layer

\footnotesize
```{r, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=2}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_point(aes(col = color), alpha = 0.2) + geom_smooth()
```


`ggplot` usually gives sensible results, but, e.g., the authors are not going to be experts in smoothing algorithms. Exercise caution and use your judgement!

# Equivalent calls

\footnotesize
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point()
ggplot(diamonds) + geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price))
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) + geom_point(aes(y = price))
```

# Layering objects

Arguments to a ggplot call:

- The first argument to a ggplot is the data frame (or tibble)
- You can fix the aesthetics with `aes()` OR you can add aesthetics in layers
- Any aspect of a plot that you want to vary based on a variable needs to be wrapped in a `aes()` call

# `aes()` calls

\footnotesize
```{r, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=2}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_point(col = "blue")
```

Color only exists locally (in the context of the diamonds), so the following results in an error:
```{r}
# ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price))+geom_point(col=color)
```


# More layers

\footnotesize
```{r, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=2}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_bw() +
  labs(x="Weight (carats)", y="Diamond price ($)") +
  ggtitle("Exploratory analysis of Diamond prices") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 3), ylim=c(0, 10000)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10))
```

# Histograms
```{r, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=2}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 200)
```


# Timeseries

\footnotesize
```{r, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=2}
g <- ggplot(gapminder %>% filter(country == "Japan"), 
            aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_line() 
g
```

# Storing and modifying

\footnotesize
```{r, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=2}
g + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1950, 2011, 15)) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Life expectancy in 20th C Japan")
```

Creating and plotting `ggplot` objects is not always fast; this may help

# Showing intervals using transparency

The most important information should be the most clear, the next most important information should be the next most clear, etc..

# Final tips

- Never, ever show a pie chart to a statistical audience... or the internet!
    * Exploding or otherwise
- Align plots with similar axes 
- Defer less important points to appendices
     * Use figures where appropriate. Would a table suffice?
- Critique your own figures 
     * Especially before public talks/conferences

# Limitations of `ggplot`

- *Forces you to use good coding practice*
    * Data should all come from the same data frame
    * Painful at first but better than a retraction!
- Constrained to two-dimensional (see `plot3d`, `scatterplot3d`)
- No graphs/trees (`igraph`)
- Static (`shiny`)
- Limited use for non-statistical graphics (Illustrator, Photoshop, Inkscape)

# Coming up

- Reminder: `git pull` -- any time you work on any file in a directory with version control!
- Homework 4 due next Thursday at the usual time in the usual way
- `shiny` with Katie Wilson
