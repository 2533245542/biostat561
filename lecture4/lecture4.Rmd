# This week

- ggplot
- shiny apps

# Graphical communication

Name to know: Edward Tufte
-

# Graphical communication

Tufte's principles for data visualisation

# Graphical communication in practice

Graphical communication is critical for both *exploring* and *explaining* data

- New tools are constantly emerging
- base graphics in R are easy to use and (usually) effective
- `ggplot` produces beautiful static plots
- `shiny` makes beautiful interactive plots (and other things!)

# ggplot

ggplot as a function available in the `ggplot2` package

- Graphics are built in layers: a plot is called, data is then drawn, then annotations are added

# ggplot

# ggplot

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price))
```

# ggplot

We first create a plotting object, *then* add plotting elements

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point()
# ggplot(diamonds) + geom_point(aes(x = caret, y = price))
# ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) + geom_point(aes(y = caret))
```

# ggplot

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point(aes(col = color), alpha = 0.2)
```

# Layering objects

Arguments to a ggplot call:

- The first argument to a ggplot is the data frame (or tibble)
- You can fix the aesthetics with `aes()` OR you can add aesthetics in layers
- Any aspect of a plot that you want to vary based on a variable needs to be wrapped in a `aes()` call

# `aes()` calls

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point(col = "blue")
# ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point(col = color)
# ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point(aes(col = "blue"))
```

# Adding layers

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

`ggplot` usually give sensible results, but, e.g., the authors are not going to be experts in smoothing algorithms. Exercise extreme caution!

# More modifications

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x="Weight (carats)", y="Diamond price ($)") +
  ggtitle("Exploratory analysis of Diamond prices") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 3), ylim=c(0, 10000))
```

# Pie charts

Never, ever show a pie chart to a statistical audience
