# Question 1: Make an R package

Submit all of the source code for an R package that does a nontrivial task. If you need inspiration, think of something that you've been annoyed about in another package and write your own implementation, or code up a statistical procedure that you've learnt in another class. 

Your package should 

- have at least one exported function
- have at least one non-exported function
- have appropriate documentation including at least one example
- require (and meaningfully use) another package
- have a `DESCRIPTION` file and a `NAMESPACE` file
- successfully build 
- not throw any errors from `devtools::check()`

If you're an experienced R user, I encourage you to make a vignette, explore the correct format for submitting data with your package, or write unit tests using `testthat`.
