## Survey

Thank you for filling out the survey! I take your feedback very seriously and I'm grateful to all of you for giving such constructive comments. 

- 14 of 17 said the material was sometimes new and sometimes familiar
- 12 of 17 said the material was sometimes difficult and sometimes easy
- Many people said that generally not having enough time was making it difficult to learn
- Most people said they wanted to see content that is already planned in the syllabus (other languages, packages, etc.)
- A couple of people wanted more data wrangling before the end of the class. Given the schedule and guest lectures, we may not have time for that but I've passed that information on to your instructor for BIOST 562, so hopefully you will see that followed-up in the next semester.
